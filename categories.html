# Who am I?
My name is Jan Palounek and Iâ€™m a developer at BinaryAge.com and the lead developer at ServerSense.net. I have started programming when I was 9 years old and since this time I'm always trying to learn something new and earn more skills and I really love it. I'm also intested in robotics and artificial intelligence (neural networks etc.). And my goal is change the world of course.
